## Core Features

### **Authentication & Security**
The platform provides comprehensive user management with secure registration and login systems. Users can authenticate through traditional email/password combinations or streamline their access using Google sign-in integration. The system includes robust password recovery through OTP-based verification, optional two-factor authentication for enhanced security, and complete session management to ensure user data protection.

### **Intelligent Dashboard**
The central hub features a dynamic user interface with personalized banners and motivational content. Students can view comprehensive statistics including university details, enrolled courses, active projects, and academic progress. The integrated calendar system synchronizes tasks, projects, notes, and course schedules, providing a unified view of academic commitments with detailed event management capabilities.

### **AI-Powered Assistant**
The intelligent chatbot operates in multiple modes to serve different user needs. Normal mode provides standard AI responses for general queries, while Context mode acts as a personalized academic assistant based on individual user data and preferences. The system includes conversation history, new chat functionality, and advanced features like prompt-based image generation with usage restrictions based on subscription plans.

### **Advanced Note-Taking System**
The comprehensive notes platform combines traditional text editing with innovative features. Students can utilize a rich-text editor supporting formatting, tables, and code blocks. The system includes text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities for accessibility, along with an Infinity Canvas for visual note-taking and mind mapping. AI integration provides automatic note summarization, PDF-to-notes conversion, and intelligent content generation.

### **Project Management Suite**
The collaborative workspace supports both individual and team projects with comprehensive management tools. Features include project timeline visualization with milestone tracking, team member management through email-based invitations, task assignment with deadline monitoring, and progress visualization. Each project includes dedicated spaces for documentation, announcements, and team communication.

### **Course Management System**
The platform categorizes courses into three types: Extra courses created by users, Active courses for current term enrollment, and Inactive courses imported from Google Classroom. Each course provides detailed information, lecture materials, announcements, coursework tracking, and submission management. The integrated course recommender uses advanced algorithms to suggest related subjects based on user behavior and preferences.

### **Smart Scheduling**
Students can create custom weekly and daily schedules with intelligent optimization features. The AI scheduler analyzes current commitments and suggests improvements for better time management and productivity. The system integrates with Google Calendar and supports automatic deadline tracking from connected educational platforms.
